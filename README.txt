This is a very simple library that uses the Rhino Javascript engine to execute
less.js which converts a LessCSS file into a standard CSS file.

The project uses maven 2.0 so you can build and install the library by issuing
the following command (provided that you have the JDK and maven installed):

    mvn clean install
